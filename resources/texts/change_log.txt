- Fixed a bug in Lightning infill where the infill was printed multiple times under certain circumstances

[4.12.0]
<i>For an overview of the new features in Cura 4.12, please watch <a href="https://youtu.be/CjFRT6Txn3U">our video</a>.</i>

* Lightning infill
The new lightning infill setting lets you to print high-quality top layers but is optimized to use less material and increase your production speed. Special thanks to rburema and BagelOrb!

* Improved top surface quality
We’ve tweaked the Monotonic setting and made adjustments throughout Ultimaker print profiles. This removes occasional scarring on models and improves top surface quality by default. 

* Improved horizontal print quality
Resulting in reduction of ringing, improving resolution and overall print quality.  

* App switcher
The new switcher provides a simpler way to navigate and use other Ultimaker applications, including Ultimaker Digital Factory, Ultimaker Marketplace, and Ultimaker 3D Printing Academy. Reporting bugs to Github is now just one click away, and it’s easier to find the application you need.

* Faster start-up
We've shaved 10 seconds from Ultimaker Cura's start-up time by optimizing profile data caching.

* Other new features:
- Moved the skip button to the left bottom on the sign in onboarding page and replaced with the sign in button and Create new account

[4.11.0]
<i>For an overview of the new features in Cura 4.11, please watch <a href="https://youtu.be/OcFkcDyO5DU">our video</a>.</i>

* Monotonic ordering
The new Monotonic top/bottom order setting enables users to print parts with smoother top surfaces. This is especially useful for parts that need good aesthetics, such as visual prototypes. Or for parts that benefit from smooth surfaces, such as those that contact-sensitive components. 

* Complete UI refresh
Look around and you will notice that we have refreshed over 100 icons throughout Ultimaker Cura. The new icons are designed for clarity – resulting in a simpler and more informative slicing experience. Also, when scaling the Ultimaker Cura window, the UI will adapt, resulting in less visual clutter.

* Improve logging of errors in OAuth flow
When helping a user with log-in problems it is easier to see where the OAuth flow goes wrong.

*<i>From version 4.11 onwards - Ultimaker Cura is only supported on operating systems actively maintained by their software manufacturer or community. This means Windows 7 and MacOS 10.13 will no longer be supported. Technically this means Ultimaker will stop testing and developing for such operating systems. However, even though it is no longer supported, there is still a high likelihood the application keeps functioning.</i>

[4.9.0]
<i>For an overview of the new features in Cura 4.9, please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=q7IJ0I9Mi1I&feature=youtu.be">our video</a>.</i>

* Digital factory integration.
Now you can open files directly from Digital Library projects. Then, after preparation, quickly and easily export them back. This feature is available for all users with an Ultimaker Essentials, Professional, or Excellence subscription. <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/enterprise-software"> Learn more</a>

* "Line type" is now the default color scheme.
When entering the Preview mode, you don't have to switch manually to line type.

This ensures that you will know whether the seam will be sufficiently hidden in the end product. This will also indicate the starting point of the print.
<i> Thanks to BasF0 for contributing to this feature </i>

* New 'line width' color-scheme available in preview mode.
Line-width can now be selected as a color-scheme in preview mode.

* Weight estimation in decimals.
This provides a more detailed idea of the amount of material used - which is especially useful for smaller prints. 

* Split Shell category into Walls and Top/Bottom. 
The shell category was a mix of settings about walls and settings about top/bottom, splitting them into two categories makes more sense.

The ability to have thumbnails embedded. Contributed by Gravedigger7789.

* Add checkbox for Extruder Offsets.
Ability to enable or disable the extruder offsets to gcode. This will be enabled by default, unless it is in the printer's def.json file. Contributed by RFBomb.

If you had (UX, visual, graphics card) problems, specifically on (newer) MacOS versions, like Big Sur, you should be able to use this new version.
